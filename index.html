                My name is Jasmine. I am a second year student at Northeastern University.
                I am a Data Science and Math Major. I spent my first year in London. London shaped my identity and I am so grateful for the experience.
                I got to experience new cultures and travel around the world. I miss being able to go anywhere in the world and city.
                The tube in London was so well connected, as opposed to the T. 
                The London tube is also very historic. A widow's husband died and he did the voiceovers of the "mind the gap"
                When London was changing the voices, they had left the late husband's voice at the Embankment station so his wife can continue to head her husbands voice.
                The "mind the gap" saying has become an iconic saying in London and to tourists all around the world. There are shirts with the saying and other souvenirs.
                The tubes served more than one purpose. In WWII, they were used as shelters during bombings. Thousands were sheltered there everynight

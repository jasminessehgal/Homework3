                The London Tube, officially known as the London Underground, is the world’s first underground railway system, opening in 1863. 
                It’s an iconic part of London’s transportation network, consisting of 11 lines that connect 272 stations across the city. 
                The Tube covers more than 400 kilometers of track, making it one of the largest metro systems globally. 
                It not only helps millions of Londoners commute daily but also offers visitors a unique way to explore the city’s landmarks, from Big Ben to the British Museum.
                Despite its Victorian origins, the Tube has adapted over time, implementing modern technologies like contactless payment and Wi-Fi at many stations.
                The stations themselves are often rich in history and feature distinctive architecture, from the Art Deco designs of Arnos Grove to the futuristic elements of Canary Wharf. 
                For many, the Tube isn’t just a mode of transport—it’s a symbol of London’s spirit and its constant movement.
